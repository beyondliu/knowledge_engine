================

The Knowledge Engine is the engine of knowledge economy, just like the engine of the industrial era. You can use Knowledge Engine to build the ships, cars, airplanes, mowers, razors of knowledge era. Briefly, Knowledge Engine is to turn Significant Experiences into a dynamic streaming structure, e.g. knowledge. For more about Knowledge Engine, Significant Experiences, and what is knowledge, view them in the wiki.

Currently you don't see code here because we are now extracting Knowledge Engine out of the notebook project and put it here. (Update 01/2018: currently the work is underway to finally finish the open source effort and have the Knowledge Engine open source software available to be embedded in the keepwork platform from tatfook and other platforms)

For now, you can try putting down your Significant Experiences and see how that will help you. We have the selflearning platform(http://notebook.opensourcelearning.org/  or for a shorter url: http://3exps.org/) for you to put in your daily Significant Experiences. Go there and give it a try!

If you are working within a team and want to see how Significant Experiences help the knowledge cooperation within a team, currently you can try the learning group feature in the notebook site mentioned above, which should demonstrate the potential of Knowledge Engine for team learning and coopeation.
